                    I am currently in college at TSTC (Texas State Technical College) in Marshall, TX. I am pursuing my degree in Software Development. I will graduate in May of 2020. I look forward to working for a “great” company. I’m excited about the opportunities the future holds for me!

                    I have enjoyed TSTC and have gained a lot of knowledge in the area of software development.  This knowledge will be invaluable as I pursue my career.  I’ve learned that listening to others’ opinions can change my point of view and can lead me down a different path. I’ve also learned that frustration can be a valuable tool in solving problems. One of the important lessons I’ve learned is that mistakes become new learnings and always stretch my thinking.

                    It's my belief that everyone has something they are passionate about.  My passion is learning, whether it’s a new foreign language, figuring out how something works, or new things about software development.  I feel that every time I learn something new I am one step closer to a better version of myself.  Knowledge is truly power!
