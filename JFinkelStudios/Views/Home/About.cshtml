                    I have enjoyed TSTC and have gained a lot of knowledge in the area of software development.  This knowledge will be invaluable as I pursue my career.  I’ve learned that listening to others’ opinions can change my point of view and can lead me down a different path. I’ve also learned that frustration can lead to persistence until something is solved or it can lead to a disappointment. One of the unique lessons I’ve learned is that mistakes can lead to corrections.

                    It's my belief that every piece of knowledge is one additional lego piece to use. I enjoy learning new things
                    whether it’s a new foreign language, figuring out how something works, or new things about software development.
