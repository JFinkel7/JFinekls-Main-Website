                    My, Time in TSTC has been long and wonderful and I'am ready to move on to something better.
                    I've learned valuable things throughout my semester at TSTC that I know will
                    help me in my career. I’ve learned that listening
                    other's opinions can widen your point of view. Furthermore,
                    I've learned that can’t let your frustration become an enemy of yourself.
                    Lastly, the most important one of all is that there are no mistakes,
                    only lessons we need to master.

                    I belive every single person on this earth has
                    some type of interest they persue. For me however, I
                    have an interest to learn new things. whether thats
                    a new foregin language, random information that I'm curious about
                    and how it all works, or even new things about software development.
                    I like learning new things. Moreover, I feel like every time I learn something new
                    one step closer to better version of myself. Knowledge is truely power.
