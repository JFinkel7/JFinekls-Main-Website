                    My Story started from a simple search on Google. In the search bar, I searched a career test. After visiting the website, I was puzzled. I was confused how a website full of questions could help me find my future career. So, I went with my gut and gave it a shot. I had nothing to lose. Furthermore, after the test, I there were several optional careers to choose from. Now, each one that was selected for me I began to searched them on YouTube. I wanted to visually see what their job is all about. Majority of them passed my eyes. However, there was one job that caught my attention and that was Software Development. I reviewed what they do on their job and I was confused. However, to get a good insight about software development I watched several YouTube videos. When I watched what all they do, I thought that was the coolest thing ever! I was so amazed that I wanted to become a software developer. In-fact, I was so excited I wanted to go to college for it. However, during that month it was February and college classes have already started. So next, I had to find a college that would have a program for software development. During my time of searching for a right school I found TSTC and then later on I applied to the college and waited for my Fall Semester to start in August Of 2018. I was working two jobs prior to attending at TSTC. I was still excited about discovering Software Development that I couldn't wait for college to start. I really couldn't wait that I started learning eve thing there was to know about Software Development before college started.

Anyhow, it was a great start for something amazing.On March 7th, I began to learn about JavaScript. While working with JavaScript, I was very confused about programming in general. Looking back now, I remembered making more mistakes than I thought was possible. Beyond that, I also remembered my frustration level was intense. JavaScript was my first programming language and enjoyed learning how I could manipulate objects in the website. As months followed, I began to learn About ANSI C and practicing JavaScript. I've made several small coding projects while improve my knowledge as each day continued. before my first semester in college. During that time of studying I was working about 35-40 hours a week. Every day after I got off from my job I wanted to go straight to my apartment and learn the next thing. I was obsessed with it. It felt like I had no life but, now I realize how far I've come because I lived that life.

                    When I first started my semester at TSTC I was nervous and excited.
                    I was excited to go in depth about learning Software Development with
                    my new Professor Miss Phyllis Hollingshead. I noticed everyone in
                    the class was nervous and shy. However, that did not stop me from
                    asking questions in the classroom. Throughout my first semester, I enjoyed solving problems on the white board, creating
                    software projects and discovering new things about software development. Towards the end of my first semester, I discovered that I could
                    create android applications. I was really excited to know that I create my own android applications.
                    So next, I quickly downloaded Android Studio and dove right into creating my own android app. It was fun and meaningful.
                    Over several semesters in college, I learned Valuable programming skills and tips.
                    I learned how to document my code, I may need to think before I code, debugging, meaningful variable names,
                    code readability, and most important of all Do Not Re-Invent the Wheel. There is so much more that I learned but
                    overall, I learned how to program correctly. Moreover, what I realized that It's not the fact that I enjoyed creating
                    Software Applications but, the fact that I can see my code come to life that's made programming enjoyable. However,
                    if there's one thing that I really understand it's  whatever I could think of or whatever problem I had
                    could be solved with my imagination. As a result, I feel like has given me a purpose.
